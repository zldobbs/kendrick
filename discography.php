                    <h3>Section.80</h3>
                    <p>Section.80 was Kendrick Lamar's debut studio album. The album defined the start of a molding process that would eventually lead to the creation of the greatest rapper alive. This album comes after his signing with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). It contained numerous classics like ADHD, Rigamortus, and HiiPower that would garner a lot of attention from critics and fans alike.</p>

                    <h3>good kid, m.A.A.d city</h3>
                    <p>Kendrick's second album propelled him into commercial success with numerous hits such as Poetic Justice and Swimming Pools (Drank). The album was unique because it featured audio recordings from Kendrick Lamar's friends and family. The gritty album brought to life the difficulties of growing up in a bad environment. In Kendrick's sense, this was of course about his life growing up in Compton. The album varies in the stories from listening to his mother and father arguing over a set of dominoes to watching his brother get shot during a gun fight.</p>

                    <h3>To Pimp A Butterfly</h3>
                    <p>This soul, jazz funk masterpiece took a wild turn from Kendrick's previous releases. His lyrics took less of an introspective turn and instead decided to hold an uncomfortable mirror in the face of the corrupt American society. To Pimp A Butterfly recieved massive critical and commercial acclaim. It was widely recognized as one of the best albums of 2015. Kendrick used his masterful delivery and lyricism to analyze themes in African-American culture, racial inequality, depression, and institutional discrimination.</p>

                    <h3>untitled unmastered.</h3>
                    <p>untitled unmastered came as a surprise to fans. The unannounced album contained eight untitled songs produced while working on his previous album, To Pimp A Butterfly. While the songs included on the album were only demos and certainly lacking in polishing, the raw examination of psychological and cultural themes proved to be just as successful as before. </p>

                    <h3>DAMN.</h3>
                    <p>Kendrick's latest release and quite possibly his hardest hitting album to date. Kendrick decided to return to his roots with this album, often focusing more on his own issues rather than society as a whole. Each song is a statement, titled in all caps with a period at the end. They serve to show Kendrick's anger he feels towards himself and others. He finds himself struggling with his relationship with God, his fear of death, lust, and numerous other introspective themes. DAMN. became certified platinum in just under three weeks after release.</p>
